# xcompact-stl_2_epsilon_generator
A python code to generate epsilon function from an STL geometry. Epsilon function is a method to define a geometry in the DNS simulations using the [Xcompact3d](https://github.com/xcompact3d/Incompact3d) code. The code takes input the STL file of the geometry, domain size, mesh size and the position of geometry in the domain and outputs the epsilon function for the simulation case. 

The code is based on the trimesh python library for the import and manipulation of the STL geometry. A big shout out to [trimesh](https://github.com/mikedh/trimesh) library for making it possible. 

***NOTE: The code is in development phase. If you want to contribute you can create a pull request and discuss it with me through mail. Reach me out [here](mailto:gauravxpgupta@gmail.com)***
